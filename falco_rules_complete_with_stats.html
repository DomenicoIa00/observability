The non-shell applications that are monitored are  defined in the protected_shell_spawner macro, with protected_shell_spawning_binaries being the list you can  easily customize. For Java parent processes, please note that Java often has a custom process name. Therefore,  rely more on proc.exe to define Java applications. This rule can be noisier, as you can see in the exhaustive  existing tuning. However, given it is very behavior-driven and broad, it is universally relevant to catch  general Remote Code Execution (RCE). Allocate time to tune this rule for your use cases and reduce noise.  Tuning suggestions include looking at the duration of the parent process (proc.ppid.duration) to define your  long-running app processes. Checking for newer fields such as proc.vpgid.name and proc.vpgid.exe instead of the  direct parent process being a non-shell application could make the rule more robust.\n</td>

'Interactive' is defined as new processes as descendants of an ssh session or login process. Consider further tuning  by only looking at processes in a terminal / tty (proc.tty != 0). A newer field proc.is_vpgid_leader could be of help  to distinguish if the process was "directly" executed, for instance, in a tty, or executed as a descendant process in the  same process group, which, for example, is the case when subprocesses are spawned from a script. Consider this rule  as a great template rule to monitor interactive accesses to your systems more broadly. However, such a custom rule would be  unique to your environment. The rule "Terminal shell in container" that fires when using "kubectl exec" is more Kubernetes  relevant, whereas this one could be more interesting for the underlying host.\n</td>

Particularly useful for newer rules like "Drop and execute new binary in container" during incident  response investigations. This helps identify common anti-patterns of ad-hoc debugging. Simultaneously, to maintain  optimal hygiene, it's recommended to prevent container drifts and instead opt for redeploying new containers.\n</td>
